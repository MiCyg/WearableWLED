# Wearable WLED

A compact, battery-powered LED controller designed for wearable light-up clothing projects. It is created by esp32-c3 mini, contains battery pack power switch and additional button (not used yet but in future maybe, hah).

This project is a specialized implementation of the popular [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) firmware, tailored specifically for wearable applications. It combines the powerful LED control capabilities of WLED with a custom-designed, battery-powered hardware platform and 3D-printable enclosure.

While WLED handles all the complex LED animations, effects, and wireless control, Wearable WLED focuses on making it portable and practical for clothing integration - with proper power management, compact form factor, and mechanical design optimized for wearables.
